## 🚀 How To Install And Setup The DedSec Project

Get the DedSec Project command-line tools running on your **Android device with Termux**.

### Requirements

| Component | Minimum Specification |
| :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Device** | Android with Termux installed |
| **Storage** | Min **8GB** free. (Images and recordings also consume space.) |
| **RAM** | Min **2GB** |

### Step-by-Step Setup

> **Note:** To install APKs (e.g., F-Droid), ensure you enable unknown sources in **Settings > Security > Install Unknown Apps**.

1.  **Install F-Droid & Termux**
    F-Droid is the recommended way to install Termux and other security tools.
    * Download and install the [F-Droid APK](https://f-droid.org/).
    * Open F-Droid and search for **Termux** to install it.
    * **Recommended Add-ons:** Install **Termux:API** and **Termux:Styling** from F-Droid for full functionality.

2.  **Update Packages & Install Git**
    Open Termux and run the following command to make sure your packages are up-to-date and `git` is installed:
    ```bash
    pkg update -y && pkg upgrade -y && pkg install git nano -y && termux-setup-storage
    ```
    > **Tip:** To prevent the screen from turning off during long operations: long-press the Termux terminal, then tap 'More' and select 'Keep screen on'.

3.  **Clone the Repository**
    Download the project files from GitHub:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/dedsec1121fk/DedSec](https://github.com/dedsec1121fk/DedSec)
    ```

4.  **Run the Setup Script**
    Navigate into the project directory and run the setup script. It will handle the complete installation for you.
    ```bash
    cd DedSec && bash Setup.sh
    ```
    > The script will handle the complete installation. After the process, you will see a settings menu; you must choose **Change Menu Style** and then choose a menu style: **list, grid, or number**. Then, close Termux from your notifications and reopen it.
    > 
    > **Quick Launch:** After setup, you can quickly open the menu by typing `e` (English) or `g` (Greek) in Termux.
