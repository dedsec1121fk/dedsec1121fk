# Download My Repositories

This Python script downloads all my repositories at once and updates them.

## Installation

1. Create the Python script:
   ```bash
   nano clone.py
   ```

2. Copy and paste the following code into `clone.py`:

   ```python
   import os
   import requests

   # GitHub username
   username = 'dedsec1121fk'  # Change this to the desired GitHub username

   # GitHub API URL to get the repositories
   url = f'https://api.github.com/users/{username}/repos'

   # Get the list of repositories
   response = requests.get(url)
   repos = response.json()

   # Clone or update each repository
   for repo in repos:
       repo_name = repo['name']
       clone_url = repo['clone_url']
       
       if os.path.isdir(repo_name):
           # If the repo already exists, pull the latest changes
           os.chdir(repo_name)
           os.system('git pull')
           os.chdir('..')
           print(f'Updated: {repo_name}')
       else:
           # Clone the repository if it doesn't exist
           os.system(f'git clone {clone_url}')
           print(f'Cloned: {repo_name}')
   ```

3. Save and exit the editor.

## Usage

Run the script with the following command:
```bash
python clone.py
```
